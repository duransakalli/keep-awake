<h1 align="center" id="title">The Idea Behind the Script</h1>

<p id="description">The logic is straightforward. By automating a harmless keyboard press at regular intervals your system believes you’re active. <br /> This method ensures that your status remains ‘online’ or ‘busy’ preventing any prying eyes from noticing your short absence. <br /><br /> This script will send a period (“.”) keystroke to the active window every 3 seconds for a duration based on the $minutes parameter (defaulting to 60 times). <br /><br /> If you run the script as is it will send a period key press to the active window every 3 seconds for a total of 60 times which equates to 3 minutes. If you want it to run for a different duration you'd need to provide a different value for the $minutes parameter when executing the script.</p>
